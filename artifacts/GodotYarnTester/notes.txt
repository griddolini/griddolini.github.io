Things that the user end gives a shit about:
---
Dialogue will happen
Choices will be presented
Events can be fired during said dialogue


Endpoints that should be allowed :
---
do_next() : fire the next signal, which either a say() or a choice() or an event() that should already be subscribed to
choice_response(string) : return a response to a question, as of now will go to a new node
get_variable(key) : get a variable used in storyteller from outside a dialogue
set_variable(key, value) : set a variable used in storyteller from outside a dialogue
remove_variable(key) : remove a variable used in storyteller from outside a dialogue

Things the dialogue will want to do :
---

if bool true/false, if number is less/greater/equal do speech, choices, etc
<<if $var is (not) true/false/lol>>
<<if $var /=/</>/<=/>=/!= 32>>

set variable
<<set $var true/false/32/abracradabra>>
<<set $var (+/-)2>>

fire an event, maybe with an argument. argument could be hard coded or another variable
<<$eventname arg1 arg2 arg3>>

<<if (not) visited>>: a built in variable, private to each yarn file. false for first interaction, then true after leaving.
