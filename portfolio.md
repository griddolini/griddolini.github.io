# Grid Sherman ePortfolio

## Intro
My name is Grid Sherman, and I'm a Software Engineer with just over 4 years of experience. I will be graduating from Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) in March, with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. This ePortfolio serves to give a little background about me and what I'm interested in, as well as showing some of the work I've done on my own and with SNHU.
This portfolio will target 3 areas of software development:

- Software Design and Engineering
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Databases

I'll be providing a professional self assessment first, followed by a video code review of 3 artifacts I have chosen to demonstrate my capabilities. Each artifact can be assessed in greater detail by clicking their respective links.

## Artifact 1
This artifact is focusing on one aspect of my Godot Yarn Tester tool. This is a tool I’ve been developing over the past few months to test out dialogue scripts written for video games or other interactive media. It provides an intuitive user interface that allows you to test out these dialogue scripts before you even bother integrating them into their final purpose. The core application source code will be used across two of my artifacts. In this artifact, I’m focusing on a specific aspect of this tool: the parsing of yarn files and the logic behind adding new user commands.\

## Artifact 2 
In this artifact, I’m focusing on the “action queue” and the surrounding code to utilize it. This is an internal design I’ve made to allow developers that choose to use this tool to receive the next line of dialogue or events at their own pace. This is necessary because the yarn files are parsed in one function call, but then need to be read back piece by piece either by the player or developer’s intervention.\

## Artifact 3
This artifact is from my CS 340 class - Client Server Architecture. In this class, we constructed a REST API in Python that interfaced to a MongoDB server. The data we manipulated was a large dump of various stocks, prices, and statistics for each one indicated by a “ticker”. The REST API allows users to hit URL endpoints to perform operations on the data, as well as a handful of custom queries allowing easy access to specific kinds of data.\
