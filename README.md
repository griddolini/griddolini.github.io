# Grid Sherman ePortfolio
## SNHU CS 499

### Intro
My name is Grid Sherman, and I'm a Software Engineer with just over 4 years of experience. I will be graduating from Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) in March, with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. This ePortfolio serves to give a little background about me and what I'm interested in, as well as showing some of the work I've done on my own and with SNHU.
This portfolio will target 3 areas of software development:

- Software Design and Engineering
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Databases

I'll be providing a professional self assessment first, followed by a video code review of 3 artifacts I have chosen to demonstrate my capabilities. Each artifact can be assessed in greater detail by clicking their respective links.
